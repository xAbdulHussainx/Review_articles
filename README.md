This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression to classify baby product reviews as positive or negative. The dataset consists of 18,506 reviews, which were processed and analyzed to determine sentiment orientation. Using this model, we can predict any reviews are positive or negative with a 90% accuracy score.
